Every blog on LiveJournal has its own RSS feed. You have access to both public 
and friends-only entries via RSS if you are in the friends list of the blogger. 
If not, only public entries are available.

The good news is that LiveJournal supports digest-authentication that allows
reading both open and closed entries via RSS.

But the bad news is that Google Reader, which I use to read RSS 
feeds, does not support this method of authentication, and I have to visit
LiveJournal website every time I want to read my friends page.

However, there is a good site http://freemyfeed.com, which understands this 
method of authentication and serves as an intermediary, giving the user 
RSS-feed with all entries.

So I wrote a script that gets list of your friends
(thanks to David Lynch for his excellent library lj.py) and generates OPML-file
for FreeMyFeed containing RSS feeds that do not require authorization.

Unfortunately, there is another problem. In LJ closed blog entries can be 
of two types:
    
    1) available to all friends
    2) available to certain group of friends

The entries of the second type can not be read via RSS, even after authentication. 
Only using web interface. 

This is a serious problem that I haven't found solution for yet. If you have any 
ideas about this, feel free to contact me.
